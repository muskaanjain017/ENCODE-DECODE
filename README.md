# ENCODE-DECODE
Secure your Information by Encoding the messages

## Message Encode-Decode
Message encoding and decoding is the process to first convert the original text to the random and meaningless text called ciphertext. This process is called encoding. Decoding is the process to convert that ciphertext to the original text. This process is also called the Encryption-Decryption process.

## Message Encode-Decode Python Project
This objective of this project is to encode and decode messages using a common key. This project will be built using the Tkinter and base64 library.

In this project, users have to enter the message to encode or decode. Users have to select the mode to choose the encoding and decoding process. The same key must be used to process the encoding and decoding for the same message.

## Project Prerequisites :pencil:

To build this project we will use basic concept of python, Tkinter, and base64 library.

- **Tkinter is a standard GUI python library**
- **base64 module provides a function to encode the binary data to ASCII characters and decode that ASCII characters back to binary data.**

To install the library we use pip install command on the command prompt(no need if you have Python3)

```
pip install tkinter
pip install base64
```
